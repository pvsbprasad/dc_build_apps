# repository-tools integrations

The following is automatically handled between _workshop-tools_ and _repository-tools_:

### New workshop sessions

> [!NOTE]
> After a workshop event is created in _workshop-tools_ (see [creating a workshop event](pages/14-workshop-requirements/README.md))

New sessions created for that workshop in _repository-tools_ will be propagated to _workshop-tools_ automatically.

### Registrations excel file

The registration excel used to upload participants in _workshop-tools_ is kept as reference for Emmanuel in _repository-tools_ when you upload the participants to the workshop.

### Participant data

When closing the workshop, participation data (registration and attendance) is sent to _repository-tools_ (if CRM is populated).
