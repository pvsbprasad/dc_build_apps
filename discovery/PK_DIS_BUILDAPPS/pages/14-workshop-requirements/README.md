# What is needed to onboard a new workshop

## Create an Event in _repository-tools_

The first step is to register the workshop in _repository tools_. To do that, you just need a name, description and BTP services involved. This event will have a unique ID when created.

After creation, press the button _Create in workshop-tools_.

## Other workshop configurations

### Decide which exercise page you will use

Either [set up a website with Docsify](pages/01-setting-repository/README.md), as explained in this guide, or use any other link: Technical Academy, GitHub repo, SAP Developer tutorial...

### Decide which credentials you want to distribute

If the participants need credentials to access the exercises or any tool, prepare the users and passwords.

The workshop will be linked to one or more systems and credentials (read more in [credentials and systems](pages/16-credentials-systems/README.md)), and the tool can generate random passwords for you (see [random passwords](pages/12-random-passwords/README.md)).

You can [send **one** set of credentials via email](pages/42-send-credentials/README.md) to the participants. You can distribute additional credentials using a Docsify exercise page with [dynamic content](pages/12-dynamic-content/README.md).

### Decide whether you want to verify participants completing the exercises

Read more in [Exercises and approvals](pages/15-exercises-approvals/README.md)

### Decide the owner of the workshop event

The workshop event has _owners_, who have rights to change the systems, credentials, exercises, name...
