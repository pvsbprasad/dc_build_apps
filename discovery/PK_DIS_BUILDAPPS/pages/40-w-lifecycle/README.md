# The life of a workshop

Workshops have the following structure:

- The **workshop event series**: The name and topic you will cover, the exercise page that you'll use... (this is the Event in _repository-tools_)
- The **workshop sessions**: Each time that you deliver it, with dates, participants... (this is the Session in _repository-tools_)

Here is the complete lifecycle of a workshop in this tool:

One time:

1. A workshop event is created: See [workshop requirements](pages/14-workshop-requirements/README.md)

For every delivery:

2. A workshop session is added: See [_repo-tools_ integration](pages/13-repo-tools-integration/README.md)
3. The workshop session is activated: See [activating a workshop](pages/40-activate-w/README.md)
4. The workshop session is delivered: 
    1. See [updating participants](pages/41-add-participants/README.md)
    2. See [sending credentials](pages/42-send-credentials/README.md)
    3. See [marking attendance](pages/43-mark-attendance/README.md)
    4. See [approving exercises](pages/44-approving-exercises/README.md)
5. The workshop session is closed: See [closing a workshop](pages/45-closing-w/README.md)
6. The workshop session is archived: This workshop session is completed and should not be shown on the main page

One time:
