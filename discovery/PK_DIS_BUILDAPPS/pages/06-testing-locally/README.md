You can do this in your own computer or in SAP Business Application Studio!

Prerequisites:

1. Install [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). You can verify if you have it installed by running the commands `node -v` and `npm -v` (they will show the installed version).

2. Install [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/quickstart) by running: `npm i docsify-cli -g`

3. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) in your computer. You can verify if you have it installed by running the command `git -v` (it will show the installed version).

Then:

1. [Clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) of your exercises to your computer

4. In the root folder of your project, run `docsify serve`. The website will be served at http://localhost:3000
