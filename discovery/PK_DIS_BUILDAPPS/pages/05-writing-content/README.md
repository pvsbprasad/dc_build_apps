# Writing content

There is no requirements on where to put content, but a best practice is the following:

- Use folders to organize the content (one folder per page, or per topic), with the markdown files inside
- Inside the folder, include everything related to that page/s: files, images, etc
    - Place files in a `files/` folder, this is important to make the files download-able
- Don't use spaces in folder or file names

Check all the things you can do [writing markdown](../pages/20-writing-markdown/README.md) to make the exercises look good.
