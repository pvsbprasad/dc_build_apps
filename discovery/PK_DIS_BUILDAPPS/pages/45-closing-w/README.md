# Closing workshops

Closing the workshop is a critical moment:

- Credentials will be restored to the default
- Participants will not be able to submit more exercises
- Participant data will be sent to repository-tools

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure all participants (except for @sap.com participants) have the CRM ID and customer name!!

> [!WARNING]
> Read the result messages, success does not mean participant data is sent!
